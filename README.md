Custom Expression Compiler & x86 Code Generator üñ•Ô∏è‚ö°

A lightweight compiler that parses a custom programming language, generates an abstract syntax tree (AST), and produces x86-style assembly code. Designed for learning compiler design and experimenting with recursive expression evaluation, function calls, and arithmetic operations.

Features

Supports function definitions and calls

Arithmetic expressions: +, -, *, /

Variable assignments and type tracking

Recursive AST traversal for code generation

Generates readable x86-like assembly for debugging and learning

Handles return statements and expression evaluation in functions

How It Works

Parsing: Converts your custom language into a tree of statements and expressions.

Symbol Table Management: Tracks variables and function scopes.

Recursive Code Generation: Converts the AST into x86-style instructions.

Function Calls: Supports arguments, return values, and nested expressions.

Getting Started

Clone the repo:

gh repo clone ArnaavSinghSandhu/SimpleLang-Compiler
cd Parser/src;


Compile the project:

javac Parser/*.java


Run the compiler with an cli interface:

java Parser.Main


Check generated_code.asm for your output assembly.

Future Improvements

Add loops and conditionals (if, while)

Optimize register allocation

Support more complex data types

Generate real x86 machine code
